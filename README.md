# Small SFML 3D Rendering Engine

Basic 3D rendering engine in SFML and C++ (Not complete)

Compiling example_program should give you a teapot, it from the top east side, slowly rotating and changing colour.

To do:
  - Multithreading
  - More dynamic lighting support
  - More adept handling of OBJ files
    - Support more OBJ features
  - Add support for other filetypes
  - Add a texturing system
  - Add proper triangle clipping
  - Create documentation on how to use (for now, look at example_program.cpp)
